                                    My name is DEEPIKA S, but I'd like to be called as dummbbb. I'm 19 years old and leaving my life to great. I'm the second child and the most naughtiest in my family. I'm very closed with my parents and my sister and my two cutie pies.


                                    I am from Tamil Nadu, shifted to Banglore during my plus one, so basically from 4 years I am in Bangalore. Bangalore is one of the great places for staying, exploring and adventure. It will always be my favourite place. I also love to watch film, listen to music or visiting to my sibling's house in my spare time. Other than that, I love to travel as well, with my cutie pies.
    
    
                                    Presently I am studying in NMIT 3rd sem Aeronautical Engineering, i am also active in NCC and many other clubs, i am an extrovert, i like to mingle with people a lot, especiallywith my trio. This is my life as people see, but reality is a different version. However, sometimes I've had a hard time since there are a lot of challenges as well. But even so, I've tried to look in a positive side, because I know dealing with human isn't an easy thing. In order to improve my work performance and myself, I believe there are still many things I have to learn, and need to strive for having a better life in the future.
